How does the script work?


Jimmy wakes up in a horse drawn cart.
He gathers his senses and looks around to see a bunch of guards
and prisoners all travelling together in a caravan.
He struggles to suck his thumb, but his hands are shackled.
"Where in the bloody seven hells am I... and why am I locked up?"
Jimmy mutters under his breath.
"Meh" replies the goat who accompanies him in the cart.
"Bloody seven hells Mr. Goat, how many goats are in this bloody cart?"
There were twenty six goats.

"What in he bloody seven hells was that?" Jimmy exclaimed.

"Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh..." (dragon).
"Almighty seven, old and new, thats a bloody Dragon!".
"Meh." (goat)

The caravan guards fight in vain as they are burned and swallowed by the dragon.
The dragon roasts and devours the horse heading Jimmy's cart, 
but miraculously, Jimmy's goat cart rolls down a hill, through the woods and
comes to a stop safely in a meadow four miles away.

After the pain and exhaustion become unbarable, he gives up and watches
the goats as the graze in the meadow. As night falls, Jimmy and the goats
pile together for warmth under the stars.

"What in the bloody seven hells is this?" a voice called out.
Jimmy is awoken by a rider on horse.
"What are you doing farming goats in my meadow? Boy!".
"Uncle Flynn? Is that you?" Jimmy croaked.
"Jimmy boy?!?!? What have you gotten yourself into, your'e all tied up!"
Uncle Flynn breaks Jimmys bonds.
"Thanks uncle Flynn, you're the best!".
"Well, start talking boy..."
"I can't remember, I was being help prisoner with these goats..."
Jimmy explained the story up to this point to Uncle Flynn.

PRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE...

"Oh yeah, now I remember! I was on my way to go tell the dragon queen that I
am her older brother's son. Then, as I was on my way, the Queen of the Realm's 
patrols captured me."
"What are you on about, you're my brother's bastard boy!"
"Yeah, well actually no, I'm like really super royal blooded."
"Alright then, well let's band together an army and take over the realm."
"It is my birthright!"
"It is your birthright!"
"Meh!" (goat)

PRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE...

"How do you suppose we rise up to command the most powerful army in the realm."
Uncle Flynn pondered aloud.
Jimmy scratched his head. One of the goats layed its head upon Jimmy's lap.
"Meh" the goat bleated.
"Well... Looks like you've got yourself a loyal army of goats!"
"Hahahahahahahaha" Jimmy laughed. "Looks like I do, dont I uncle Flynn!".
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, you sure do boy!".
"meh." (goat)
